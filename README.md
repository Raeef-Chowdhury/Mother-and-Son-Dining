## 🌟 Overview
**Mother-Son Dining** is a fully front-end website project that simulates a dining or restaurant-style interface.  
This project was my **first attempt at a larger scale website**, meant to test and showcase my abilities in:
- Writing clean **HTML** structure  
- Designing responsive layouts with **CSS**  
- Adding interactivity with **vanilla JavaScript**

---

## ✨ Features
- Static HTML pages with clean semantic structure  
- Responsive **CSS layouts** for different screen sizes  
- JavaScript for **interactivity** (e.g. navigation, menus, dynamic UI elements)  
- **Deployed with Netlify** for easy public access  
- Designed to mimic a dining website look & feel  

---

## 🎯 Motivation & Goals
This project was built to:
- Move beyond small beginner projects and **attempt something at larger scale**  
- Reinforce my understanding of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals**  
- Learn how to organize files, assets, and code in a real project structure  
- Practice deploying a working site with Netlify  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** → page structure & semantic content  
- **CSS3** → layout, styling, and responsive design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** → interactivity, DOM manipulation  
- **Netlify** → hosting & deployment

## 💡 Challenges Faced
1. **Layout & Responsiveness**  
   - Struggled to make the design adapt properly to smaller screens.  
   - Learned about **media queries** and flexible layouts.  

2. **JavaScript Interactivity**  
   - Initially had difficulty with **DOM selection and event handling**.  
   - Improved through debugging and testing different event listeners.

   - Maintaining a professional look across all pages was harder than expected.  
   - Gained experience in **typography, spacing, and color balance**.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add **dynamic menu management** (e.g., items loaded from JSON or API).  
- Implement a **booking/reservation system**.  
- Improve **form validation** with better error handling.  
- Add **light/dark mode toggle** for accessibility.
